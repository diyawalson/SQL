**📊 SQL Project – Data Analysis & Insights**

This repository contains structured SQL projects focused on extracting meaningful insights from real-world datasets. Each project demonstrates strong command over SQL queries, including data exploration, aggregation, filtering, joins, and analytical techniques.

**🧠 Objective:**

The goal of each SQL project is to analyze complex datasets using structured queries to uncover trends, patterns, and actionable insights. These projects showcase how data-driven decisions can be supported through well-designed SQL logic.

**🔧 Tools & Technologies:**

SQL Engine: MySQL

Interface: MySQL Workbench 

Optional: Python (for visualization), Python (for preprocessing)
