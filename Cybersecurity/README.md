**💻 Global Cybersecurity Threat Analysis (2015–2024)**

This project explores global cybersecurity threats between 2015 and 2024 using SQL. Through structured queries and analytical insights, it reveals patterns across countries, attack types, financial losses, affected industries, and defense mechanisms. The goal is to support data-driven strategies for cybersecurity risk mitigation and resource planning.

**📌 Project Highlights:**

Objective: Analyze cyber incidents to understand their impact, frequency, and evolution over time.

Dataset: Global_Cybersecurity_Threats_2015-2024.csv – contains year-wise data on attacks, losses, industries,                           vulnerabilities, and response times.

**Scope:**

> Unique countries and attack types

> Financial and user impact

> Vulnerability and defense patterns

> Year-wise and country-wise aggregations

**⚙️ Tools & Technologies:**

> SQL Database: MySQL 5.7+
